# Resistance Calculator

An interactive web-based calculator for analyzing electrical circuits with resistors in series and parallel configurations. This tool helps students and professionals understand and calculate resistance, voltage, and current in complex resistor networks.

## Features

- Calculate total resistance for series and parallel resistor combinations
- Dynamic circuit diagram visualization
- Real-time calculations of voltage and current distribution
- Support for both voltage-driven and current-driven analysis
- Interactive UI for adding/removing resistors
- Detailed step-by-step analysis of circuit behavior

## Usage

1. Open `resistor-diagram.html` in a web browser
2. Add resistors in series using the "Add Series" button
3. Add parallel resistors to any series component using "Add Parallel"
4. Enter either the total voltage or current
5. Click "Calculate" to see the complete analysis

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS)
- JavaScript
- SVG for circuit visualization
